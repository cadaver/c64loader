Here are some example programs using the loader. Each of them loads a picture
and shows it. The example diskimage (.D64) has now been made with interleave 12.
It's recommended to increase the interleave when using 1-bit protocol with
packed data. When using 2-bit protocol exclusively, the interleave can be
lowered.

Example .D81 image is also included for testing.
