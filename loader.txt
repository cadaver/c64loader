Please note that this source code is in DASM format, and relies heavily on
conditional assembly and relocation to compile in or leave out the various
features and to compile the drivecode and overlays. To use on other assemblers,
you'll have to convert to the format of your assembler.

Features and assumptions:
-------------------------

- V3.x is a game-oriented loader with limitations, based on c64gameframework / 
  MW ULTRA loader. The runtime part is less than one page of memory.

- Autodetection of drive programming capability & serial protocol
  * Fastloader uploaded to drives that support it:
    1541, 1571, 1581, CMD FD and CMD HD
  * IDE64 and "fast drive emulation" are detected: because these don't use
    the slow, IRQ-disabling serial protocol at all, you can still use IRQs
    quite reliably (read more about this below)
  * SD2IEC is detected and a separate compatible fastloader protocol (ELoad)
    is used

- PAL/NTSC and SuperCPU compatibility

- Compared to V2.x versions of loader, only 2-bit fastloading protocol is
  available.

- Only 2-letter filenames which are hexadecimal numbers are supported. The
  fastloader will precache directory to speed up repeated searches.

- Loader assumes Kernal will be off ($35 value in $01) during runtime.
  It will disable timer interrupt and NMI from Restore keypress when
  initializing.

- Fastloader initializes itself only once, after which the loader init and
  drivecode can be disposed. Save is supported only to preallocated files
  on the disk, instead of switching fastloader off and using Kernal routines.

- Sprite range setting for allowing sprites on while fastloading, but this
  reduces the available raster line range and slows down loading. Sprites 
  should be off when the Kernal protocol is used with an actual serial
  device (loaderMode 0)


Summary of user-callable routines:
----------------------------------

The "disposable" routines
-------------------------

InitLoader

Detects drive type and whether it supports fastloading, and if it uses the
serial protocol. Must only be called only once in the beginning.

Parameters: C=0 allow detection, C=1 default to Kernal stock protocol
            (loaderMode 0)
Returns:    ntscFlag, loaderMode and fileOpen variables set
Modifies:   A,X,Y


The runtime routines
--------------------

OpenFile

Opens a file. Must not be called when file is already open (fileOpen variable
nonzero).

Parameters: A file number
Returns:    fileOpen set to nonzero if successful
Modifies:   A,X,Y


GetByte

Reads a byte from an opened file. Must only be called if file is still open
(fileOpen variable is nonzero). Note that you must read until end of file
before you can open the next file.

Parameters: -
Returns:    A byte, fileOpen set to zero on EOF
Modifies:   A


SaveFile

Saves a file.

Parameters: A file number, zpSrcLo-zpSrcHi startaddress, zpBitsLo-zpBitsHi
            amount of bytes
Returns:    -
Modifies:   A,X,Y


SetSpriteRange

Set sprite maximum and minimum Y for fastloading when sprites are on. This
limits the rasterline Y-range on which the 2-bit timed transfer is used.
No-op in Kernal loading modes (loaderMode 0 & 1)

Parameters: A Y-coordinate of topmost sprite, X Y-coordinate of bottom-
            most sprite
Returns:    -
Modifies:   A


SetNoSprites

Clear the sprite range and allow 2-bit timed transfer anywhere on screen.
No-op in Kernal loading modes (loaderMode 0 & 1)

Parameters: A must be 0
Returns:    -
Modifies:   -


Diskside change detection (1541)
--------------------------------

The loader doesn't provide special facilities to detect diskside. Instead you
should use a "file not found" condition (OpenFile fails to set fileOpen to
nonzero) to detect the need for diskside change. The disksides should have 
different disk IDs.


Kernal loading special considerations
-------------------------------------

When loaderMode is 0 (Kernal loading) or 1 (Kernal loading, but IRQs allowed
for devices like IDE64) the loader will call into a "StopIRQ" routine at $02a7
when opening a file for load or save. By default this is just a RTS instruction,
but you can replace it with your specific code.

In loaderMode 0, you should completely shut off raster interrupts, audio and
sprites in the StopIRQ routine, because IRQs will be delayed unpredictably, and 
the stock protocol timing will not tolerate sprites being on.

Note that in fastload mode the $0200-$02ff area is used instead for the sector
buffer or ELoad helper code, and shouldn't be touched by your code.


SCPU/C128 special considerations
--------------------------------

You can speed up the CPU in your code for e.g. faster scrolling. When the loader
is compiled with USETURBOMODE define nonzero, the loader will automatically
switch back to slow mode when opening a file for load or save. However, if you
switch back to turbo mode in IRQs, observe the following: if fileOpen variable
is nonzero (file is currently open), you should not switch turbo mode on.


IDE64 special considerations
----------------------------

From the IDE64 fixing/compatibility guide at
http://www.ide64.org/ide_fix.html

- IRQ/NMI can get delayed by 30-40 cycles (like VIC's bad lines) while
  executing IDE64 calls. This may cause "raster bugs" and similar.
  To avoid this, do the raster interrupt a line earlier, and then check $D012.

- Active IRQ MUST NOT be located between $8000-$9FFF because IDE DOS has there
  IDE ROM.
