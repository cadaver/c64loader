Here are some example programs using the loader. Each of them loads a picture
and shows it. The example diskimage (.D64) has been made with interleave 13,
which is usually OK for unpacked 1-bit transfer, but not necessarily for on-
the-fly depacking. Try for example interleave 15 for better loading performance
while depacking. 2-bit loading should handle default interleave 10 (unpacked)
or 11 (packed) well.

Example .D81 image is also included for testing.
